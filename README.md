## Short Story

The robot has just left a bar after having too much alcohol. As a result, it cannot move straight and is wobbling its way around to find a way back home. However, it has to maintain its composure because there are cops on the way that check whether someone is drinking and driving - and this robot does have wheels and tyres on.
