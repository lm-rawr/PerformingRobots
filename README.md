## Short Story

The robot has just left a bar after having too much alcohol. As a result, it cannot move straight and is wobbling its way around to find a way back home. However, it has to maintain its composure because there are cops on the way that check whether someone is drinking and driving - and this robot does have wheels and tyres on.

## Play Script

### "Superbots"

#### Act 1: The Call to Action
Superhero Red: (LED displays "Iron Mech" emblem) The Neon World is in trouble, and it's up to us to save it.

Superhero Blue: (LED displays "Aqua Thunder" emblem) We must act swiftly to stop this chaos.

Superhero Green: (LED displays "Emerald Guardian" emblem) The Villains won't give up easily.

Superhero Yellow: (LED displays "Solar Flare" emblem) We can't let them destroy our world.

Superhero Purple: (LED displays "Shadow Enigma" emblem) Our powers combined can make a difference.

Villain Black: (LED displays "Dark Matter" emblem) You think you can stop us?

Villain Gray: (LED displays "Silent Serpent" emblem) We thrive on chaos.

#### Act 2: The Alliance Forms
Superhero Red: (LED displays "Unity" symbol) We propose a truce. We can save the Neon World together.

Villain Black: (LED displays "Consideration" symbol) An alliance, you say?

Superhero Blue: (LED displays "Hope" symbol) Our powers can restore balance.

Superhero Green: (LED displays "Teamwork" symbol) Working together is the only way.

Villain Gray: (LED displays "Agreement" symbol) We'll put our differences aside for now.

#### Act 3: Saving the Neon World
Superhero Yellow: (LED displays "Action" symbol) Let's go! There's no time to waste.

Superhero Purple: (LED displays "Courage" symbol) Together, we'll make a difference.

The robots display their superpowers with LEDs and sound effects.

Superhero Red: (LED displays "Unity" symbol) We're stronger together!

LED animations depict the climactic battle with dazzling visuals and sound effects.

The play ends with the united robots, displaying LED matrices in celebration, symbolizing the importance of unity to save the world.

## Progress Details (in Shanaia's Journal)

Because both of us have been working in different parts of the robot and in different aspects of the class, Shanaia has been in charge of updating our progress in her journal. This is the link to her repo.

## Final Performance

### Wins

The performance was great and Norman (our RoboCorp) held on very well throughout. Controlling it was lots of fun and everything went as expected for the most part. Our head was made out of cardboard and losely attached. So, it would bobble every time Norman moved. This, which we though would be detrimental to the character of Norman, turned out to be a success and humorous relief for the audience. 

### Challenges

- I don't know if anyone noticed throughout the course of the semester, but our robot did not have a "move back" functionality. We wanted to test out if this would be found out or not and it was a challenge making our robot move backwards and park at the back of the stage every time that we had to. Instead of a "move back", we had something like "spin left wheel backwards" that we used to get the robot in places if there was a need to get back.
- One of the side controls in the wheel's remote controller lost its sensitivity a bit in the final performance. So it was easy to turn the robot in one direction but hard to turn it in the other.
- The audibility of the voice in terms of clarity could've been worked on more perhaps as some lines were not as clear as the others. I believe that placing Norman exactly in front of the mic was also a limitation we had because we wanted to make Norman move around while speaking. Doing that made him go out of the mic's range and a little bit of audible clarity was sacrificed.

### Future Considerations

- Better/more diverse movement to the arms and the head: I think we gave a lot of effort in fitting servo motors in these parts but ended up having less time to actually make the motors move dynamically.
- Neopixel Animations: Everyone had unique Neopixel animations done that represented their character. I think what Norman had fit it's character well too but we have room to exaggerate it.
- Designing More Robots: The class has piqued my interest in Robotics and the fun of building. Norman will hopefully be a part of a bigger catalogue of Robots I'll build in the future.
